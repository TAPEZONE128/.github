**Welcome to [TAPEZONE128](https://github.com/TAPEZONE128)** era – where every repository is meant for academic documentation only. <img src="https://c.tenor.com/Ez99PJpx8PwAAAAC/tenor.gif" width="95" length="25" />

## About

**TAPEZONE128** serves as a comprehensive academic archive. This repository is designed to store and organize materials related to computer science subjects, as well as knowledge gained from external seminars and workshops attended outside of the campus. The primary goal is to separate academic content from coding and project-related repositories, creating a streamlined resource specifically for academic references and study.

### Why TAPEZONE128?  <img src="https://media.infosec.exchange/infosec.exchange/custom_emojis/images/000/170/641/static/72d670f0863a3d55.png" length="25" width="25" />

This organization was created to focus solely on academic materials without mixing them with coding project progress. This clear separation aids in focused study and makes it easier to access educational content. It is a structured space for resources, lecture notes, and insights gained beyond coursework.

## Repository Contents
