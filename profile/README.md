**TAPEZONE128** serves as a comprehensive academic archive. This repository is designed to store and organize materials related to computer science subjects, as well as knowledge gained from external seminars and workshops attended outside of the campus. The primary goal is to separate academic content from coding and project-related repositories, creating a streamlined resource specifically for academic references and study.
